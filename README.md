# Autism-Detection-from-Behavioral-Data-
A basic prototype using machine learning to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from non-clinical data. Models like Random Forest and XGBoost achieved 99.67% accuracy. Future plans include scaling the project with deep learning for more advanced, real-time ASD screening solutions.
